## Features

1. Easy setup and configurations.
2. Handling the apps from your Firebase account. Even free account works well.
3. Multiple filter options.

## Installation

**[1]** Goto https://console.firebase.google.com/<br>
- Choose Add Project<br>
- Add Your Project Details and Click on the "Create Project" button.<br>
- You should see the "Your project is ready". Click on the "Contiue" button.<br>

**[2]** Welcome to Firebase. Get started here.<br>
- Choose Add Firebase to iOS app. Click on the "iOS" button.<br>
- Add the same BundleId as in your Project. Provide other details and click on the "REGISTER APP" button.<br>
- Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and add it to your project. This is very important for the Firebase integration.

**[3]** You are now in "Overview" screen in your Firebase Dashboard.<br>
- In left panel, click on "Database" option.<br>
- Choose "Realtime Database" and click on the "GET STARTED" button.<br>
- Start in locked mode. This is important, you should know how to manage the authenticaltion with Firebase.<br>
- In Database, "Data" should be selected. <br>
- Click on "add child" [+] button.<br>
- In name, make sure you give "AppCommander" and the value should be a JSON. Sample is added [here](https://github.com/hemangshah/AppCommander/blob/master/AppCommander/AppCommander/Source/AppCommanderSampleJSON.txt). Add the keys as per the requirements.<br>
- Hit enter to add it into the Database.<br>
- Goto "RULES" tab next to the "DATA" tab.<br>
- For testing, set `.read` to `true`.

**[4]** Install Firebase Database to your project using CocoaPods. This is the command: `pod Firebase/Database`. **Note**: You can also install it manually. Or with the sample project you only need to do `pod install` since it has already included a podfile.

**[5]** Add all the files from `AppCommander/Source` folder to your Project.

> You can read the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hemangshah/AppCommander/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file for a particular release.

## Usage

1.  **Config** `AppCommander` in `AppDelegate.swift`.
````swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Override point for customization after application launch.        
        AppCommander.commander.config()        
        return true
}
````
    
2. Listen to commands from the `AppCommander` anywhere in your project. The suitabel place is in `AppDelegate` only after configuring the `AppCommander`.
````swift
AppCommander.commander.execution = { command in
   let commandName = command.name ?? ""
   if !commandName.isEmpty {
      if commandName == "forceExit" {
         self.forceExit()
      }
   }
}
````

3. Write an action to handle the received command.
````swift
fileprivate func forceExit() {
    exit(1)
}
````

4. Done! âœ…
